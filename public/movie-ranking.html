<h1>The Best Movies According to Fatih</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr>
<h3>The Mask</h3>
<p>A beautiful and a really funny movie that I watched on the VHS way back in the day.
It's actually one of the first movies I've ever seen in my life!</p>
<h3>Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny</h3>
<p>Again, a really funny movie with one of my all time favorite actors Jack Black starring in it. It inspied me a great deal as a young musician. Still does, to this day!</p>
<h3>Waking Life</h3>
<p>A very philosophical movie that's also very interesting visually. It's a very creative and a very deep movie that gets you thinking!</p>
